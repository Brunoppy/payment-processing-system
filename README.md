  - Identify unpaid or overdue payments.
  - Analyze payments grouped by method.

## How to Use
1. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Use MySQL or a compatible DBMS.
   - Run the `payment_processing.sql` script to create the database and populate it with sample data.

2. **Analyze Payment Data**:
   - Use the queries provided to gain insights into payment performance, pending payments, and revenue breakdown.

3. **Integration**:
   - This project is designed to integrate with the `customer_orders`, `inventory_management`, and `sales_management` systems.

## SQL Highlights
- **ENUM Type** for payment statuses.
